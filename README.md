# Matomo DevelopmentToogle Plugin

## Description

This plugin adds a new icon to the main navbar for admins that quickly toogles the development features.

Disabling the development mode makes Matomo far quicker as caches aren't disabled.

```ini
[Development]
enabled = 0
disable_merged_assets = 0
```
